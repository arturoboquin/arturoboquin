# Hi there, I'm Arturo Boquin üëã

It's a pleasure to meet you!
I've navigated through various roles in finance, risk management, and data science to where I am today.

üöÄ **About Me**

With over 10 years of experience across banking, FMCG, and consulting sectors, my journey began in civil engineering, transitioning into finance and risk analytics, and ultimately converging on data science and business intelligence. An MBA from INCAE Business School and a Master's in Data Science from the University of British Columbia have equipped me with a robust toolkit for driving business transformation through data-driven strategies. Currently, as a Financial Planning & Analysis Manager at Gildan, I leverage data analytics to optimize financial operations worldwide. My passion lies in melding analytical rigor with strategic insight to solve complex business challenges.
